### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: Analysis on work-related happy moments
+ This project is conducted by [your name]

+ Project summary: This project aims to construct an LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model for the purpose of identifying work-related moments. We seek to discern which countries prioritize work as their primary source of happiness and explore the types of happy moments people commonly share. Furthermore, we specifically examine married individuals with children to determine whether they predominantly share moments related to family or work.
